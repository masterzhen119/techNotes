## Typora

Personal Tips:

- copy image and then paste it into the editor, the image will also be copied into the cache folder of typora. To avoid that, just directly use the absolute path of the image. First copy the image file, and then paste it into the address bar in Chrome, which will display the absolute path like, `file://`.
